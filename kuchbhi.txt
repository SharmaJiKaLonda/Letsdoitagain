It always starts with the vengeance I don't know but It has to. And Once it began one has to
finish. It can be between two, among three..four..five.. but usually it is between two.
But what "it" is? Well 'IT' is most dangerous and courageous thing which every sane person 
will always avoid, 'IT' has always disastrous results. 'IT' is WAR.
